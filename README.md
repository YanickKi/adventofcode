# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

This repo contains my own solutions written in python. I've attended the Advent of Code purely for practice purposes, so don't be bothered by poorly written code :-)
